              <h3>Who is this package for?</h3>
              <p className="install">
                This package was designed to make offline caching easier for anyone using a GraphQL
                API. The package is extremely small, because it leverages existing browser-native
                APIs like{' '}
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">
                  service workers
                </a>{' '}
                and{' '}
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">
                  {' '}
                  IndexedDB{' '}
                </a>{' '}
                It's a great choice for developers looking for an out-of-the-box offline caching
                solution, and who don't wan't to use a heavier alternative like Apollo Client.
              </p>
              <p className="install">
                The package is capable of caching GraphQL queries made via GET or POST requests.

              <h3>Installation</h3>
              <p>First, install the package using your favorite package manager.</p>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="bash" style={dracula}>
                $ npm install loql-cache
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
              <p>
                After installing loql, you'll need to tell your bundler to include the service
                worker file with your code. With Webpack, this can be accomplished a single line in
                the configuration file.
              </p>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={dracula}>
                {webpack}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
              <p>
                Great! When you build your site, you should now see a loQL.js file included inside
                of your public folder. Now, we need to register that service worker and set up our
                caching strategies.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h3>Registration</h3>
              <p>
                The loQL service worker needs to be registered at some point in your project. It
                also needs to be told which GraphQL endpoints to cache data fromâ€”this is the only{' '}
                <em>required</em> configuration setting.
              </p>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={dracula}>
                {registration}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
              <p>
                Your service worker will now cache data from the GraphQL API. By default, the
                service worker will employ a "cache-first" network strategy. This can be configured
                during the registration step. The full list of configuration options are detailed
                below.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h3>Configuration</h3>
              <p>
                The loQL service worker is designed to be highly configurable. Each of these values
                can be passed into the register function and will be used when the worker is first
                registered to the page.

                    that should not be cached, see the <i>doNotCacheCustom</i> setting.

              <p>
                This package is still in beta, and currently does not support mutations, directives,
                and subscriptions. The team is currently developing a normalized caching solution
                that will enable mutation support.
